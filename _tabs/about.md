I'm Victor, an Electrical and Electronics Engineering student at the University of Nairobi, with an interest in cyber security and computational problem-solving.

I'm particularly interested in securing systems and ensuring robust security by finding and addressing flaws and vulnerabilities. I spend part of my leisure time learning optimization algorithms and solving programming challenges.
