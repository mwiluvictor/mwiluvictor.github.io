I'm Victor, a `Cyber Security Analyst` with an interest in computational problem-solving.

I'm particularly interested in securing systems and ensuring robust security by finding and addressing flaws and vulnerabilities. I spend part of my leisure time learning optimization algorithms and solving programming challenges. 

This personal blog is an archive of topics and concepts that I find interesting and valuable. My interests include network security, application security, penetration testing, exploit development and reverse engineering. Therefore, this blog acts as a reference to what I document and is available to be consumed by all. Welcome!!
