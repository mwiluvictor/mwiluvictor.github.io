I'm Victor, `Cyber Security Analyst` with an interest in  computational problem-solving.

I'm particularly interested in securing systems and ensuring robust security by finding and addressing flaws and vulnerabilities. I spend part of my leisure time learning optimization algorithms and solving programming challenges. 

This personal blog site is an archive of topics and concepts that I find interesting and important to learn about.
